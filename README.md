The ItemTracking application is designed to analyze text records generated by the Corner Grocer throughout the day. The application provides functionality to track the frequency of items purchased and present the information in various formats.

Functionality
The ItemTracking application provides the following functionality:
1.	Frequency Count: The user can search for a specific item by entering its name. The application will display the frequency of that item in the input file.
2.	Frequency List: The application can print a list of all items along with their respective frequencies from the input file.
3.	Histogram: The application can generate a histogram representation of the item frequencies. It prints the name of each item followed by asterisks (*) representing the numeric amount.
4.	Backup File: Upon initialization, the application automatically creates a backup file named "frequency.dat" in the current working directory. This file contains all the item-frequency pairs from the input file, providing a backup of the accumulated data.
5.	Menu System: The application presents a menu-driven interface to the user. The user can select options by entering a corresponding number. The program validates user input to ensure valid choices are made.

I believe that the code is presented in an efficient and easy to understand manner. The menue system could be expanded to include more options and the ItemTracker.cpp class is able to handle additional methods. Understanding how to utilize the header file to keep the variable declarations clean and usable through the rest of the code was key to making the application work properly. I have spent some time trying to wrap my mind around how to use an interface properly and am finally starting to get it. I can also use this skill in other languages where an interface would help to maximize the efficacy and scalability of the application. In the ItemTracker.h file the class declaration and member functions prototypes serve as an interface for the ITemTracker.cpp class allowing other parts of the program to interact with the class.
